# Customer Service Training

Build a customer service training platform with AI-powered difficult customer scenarios.

## Overview

Create a platform for support teams to:
- Practice handling angry or frustrated customers
- Learn de-escalation techniques
- Improve communication skills
- Track performance metrics

## Scenario Examples

### Angry Customer

```json
{
  "name": "Billing Dispute",
  "ai_instructions": "You are a customer who was charged $299 unexpectedly. You're angry and threatening to leave a bad review. Calm down if the agent shows empathy and offers a solution."
}
```

### Technical Support

```json
{
  "name": "Product Not Working",
  "ai_instructions": "Your product stopped working and you have a deadline in 2 hours. You're stressed but not angry. You need clear, step-by-step help."
}
```

## Implementation
