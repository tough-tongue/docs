# Sales Training App

Create a comprehensive sales training platform with AI-powered roleplay scenarios.

## Overview

Build a platform where sales reps can:
- Practice cold calls and demos
- Handle objections in realistic scenarios
- Receive coaching feedback
- Track improvement metrics

## Scenario Examples

### Cold Call Practice

```json
{
  "name": "Enterprise SaaS Cold Call",
  "ai_instructions": "You are a busy CTO at a 500-person company. You're skeptical of sales calls but willing to listen if the pitch is relevant. Push back on pricing and ask about integration capabilities."
}
```

### Demo Practice

```json
{
  "name": "Product Demo - Technical Buyer",
  "ai_instructions": "You are a senior developer evaluating tools. Ask detailed technical questions about architecture, security, and performance. Be critical but fair."
}
```

### Negotiation Practice

```json
{
  "name": "Price Negotiation",
  "ai_instructions": "You love the product but the price is too high. Try to negotiate a 30% discount. If the rep provides good value justification, you'll accept a 15% discount."
}
```

## Implementation
