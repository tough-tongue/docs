Control who's in your organization, what they can do, and how much they can use.

## Roles

| Role | Can manage members | Can view analytics | Content access |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Member** | ❌ | ❌ | Only what's shared with them |
| **Admin** | ✅ | ✅ | Only what's shared with them |
| **Owner** | ✅ | ✅ | Only what's shared with them |

**Important:** Admins/Owners have org privileges but don't automatically access
scenario content. Creators always control their content.

## Adding Members

**Individual:** Account Settings → Members → Add Member
- Email (required)
- Name, Role, Quota (optional)
- Non-existing accounts created automatically

**Bulk CSV:**
```csv
email,name,role,quota_minutes
john@example.com,John Doe,view,25.0
jane@example.com,Jane Smith,edit,100.0
```

Valid roles: `view`, `read`, `edit`, `owner`

## Quotas

- Assign per-member usage limits (minutes)
- No quota = default organizational quota
- Members see remaining quota on billing page

## Scenario Access Control

When creating scenarios, set org-wide permissions:

| Level | Who sees what |
|-------|--------------|
| **Interact + view own** | Practice, see only personal history |
| **Interact + view all** | Practice, see everyone's sessions |
| **Interact + edit + view all** | Full collaborative access |
| **Private** | Only people you explicitly add |

Use **Manage Access** to grant individual users specific permissions.
