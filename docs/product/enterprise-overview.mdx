Enterprise accounts enable teams to use Tough Tongue AI within a shared workspace.

## What You Get

- **Member management** with roles and quotas
- **Organization-wide analytics**
- **Fine-grained access controls** for scenarios

1. Go to **Account Settings → Organizations**
2. Click **Create Organization**
3. **Important:** Uncheck "Make page public" to enable Enterprise features

- Scenario creators control their content
- Admins have org privileges but **cannot access scenario content** unless shared
