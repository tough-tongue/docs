Build voice agents by describing what you want. No coding required.

<Tip>
  **Scenario Studio** is also called "Advanced Scenario Creator" in the app.
</Tip>

## Creating a Scenario

1. Go to [Scenario Studio](https://app.toughtongueai.com/advanced-scenario-create)
2. Describe your agent in natural language
3. Configure settings and deploy

## What Your Prompt Controls

Your scenario input determines three things:

| Element | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Role** | AI's persona and tone (positive, skeptical, humorous) |
| **Agenda** | Questions to ask and how to probe |
| **Evaluation** | Scoring criteria for analysis |

## Writing Effective Prompts

**Name format:** `[Coach Name]: [Situation]`

Examples:
- "PM Interviewer: Analytics Question"
- "Sales Coach: Cold Call Practice"
- "HR Manager: Performance Review"

**Set the role:** Use "You are [Role]" with a tone.

```
You are a skeptical VP of Engineering evaluating a technical pitch.
Be direct, ask tough questions, and push back on vague claims.
```

**Add context:** Attach materials to make scenarios more realistic:
- PDF documents (pitch decks, playbooks)
- Blog post links
- YouTube videos
- Google Slides

## Conversation Strategies

| Mode | Best for |
|------|----------|
| **Talkative** | AI leads, continues even if user is silent. Good for interviews. |
| **Quiz** | Jumps straight to analysis after session. No avatar display. |
| **Conductor** | Timed actions at specific moments. Control session length. |

## Controlling Session Duration

**Per-link control:** Add `?maxDuration=600` to URL (600 = 10 minutes)

**Scenario-level control:** Use Conductor Mode with timed messages:
- At 540s: "You have one minute left"
- At 600s: "End the call and say thank you"

## Sharing Options

- **Public link:** Anyone can access
- **Single-use links:** One-time access with optional user info collection
- **Embed via iframe:** White-label in your app
- **Organization-only:** Restrict to team members
