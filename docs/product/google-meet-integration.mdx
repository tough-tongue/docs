## Two Ways to Use Meeting Bot

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Custom Meeting Mode">
    **Best for:** One-off meetings, dual meetings, or ad-hoc meetings
    
    <Steps>
      <Step>Provide the meeting URL or Google Meet link</Step>
      <Step>Specify when you want the bot to join</Step>
      <Step>Done! The bot will join at the specified time</Step>
    </Steps>
    
    Perfect for meetings that just appeared on your calendar or when you need precise control.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Calendar Integration Mode">
    **Best for:** Recurring meetings or automated joining
    
    <Steps>
      <Step>Grant access to your calendar</Step>
      <Step>Optionally specify a keyword filter (e.g., "interview 101")</Step>
      <Step>The bot automatically joins matching meetings</Step>
    </Steps>
    
    The keyword filter prevents the agent from joining meetings where you don't want it present.

  <Accordion title="What are the current limitations?">
    1. **Background noise sensitivity:** Works best in quiet environments
