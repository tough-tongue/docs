## Setup

1. [Create a scenario in Scenario Studio](https://app.toughtongueai.com/advanced-scenario-create/?isPublic=false)
   describing what the agent should do
2. Go to **Library → Scenario → Meeting Bot**
3. Choose your mode

## Modes

| Mode | How it works |
|------|--------------|
| **Custom Meeting** | Provide meeting URL + join time. Best for one-off meetings. |
| **Calendar Integration** | Auto-join based on keyword filter (e.g., "interview 101") |

## What Happens

- Bot joins meeting and introduces itself based on scenario
- Records transcript automatically
- Generates analysis based on scenario criteria
- Session available on your dashboard

## Removing the Bot

The Google Meet admin (person who sent the invite) can remove the bot.
Analysis still processes normally after removal.

## Limitations
