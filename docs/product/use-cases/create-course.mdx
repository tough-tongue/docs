## What You Create

A structured learning path with:
- **Your video lessons** (Loom, YouTube, etc.)
- **AI practice scenarios** between lessons
- **Progress tracking** for students

Think: dedicated teaching assistant that practices with students 24/7.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create Collection

Library → Create Collection
- Name (e.g., "Executive Leadership Mastery")
- Description of objectives
- Public or private

### 2. Add Content

**AI Scenarios:** Pick from library or create custom.

**Video Links:** Loom, YouTube, or any video URL.
Clean URLs only—no extra parameters.

### 3. Organize

Drag to reorder. Example sequence:
1. Intro video
2. AI practice scenario
3. Lesson video
4. AI roleplay
5. Wrap-up video

### 4. Publish

Share collection link. Students use "Play All" to go through in order.

## Three Outcomes

| Type | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| **Course** | Full curriculum: your lessons + AI practice |
| **Coaching Package** | Mix of 1:1 sessions with you + AI sessions |
| **Simulations** | Scenario-based modules for specific skills |

## Tips

- Add context (PDFs, docs) to AI scenarios for richer guidance
- Use clear labels for videos so students know what they're watching
- Test the flow yourself before publishing
