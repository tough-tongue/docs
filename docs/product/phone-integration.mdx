## Setup Process

These 4 steps work for all major providers.

### Step 1: Create a SIP Trunk

Go to your telephony provider's dashboard and create a new SIP trunk.

**What to look for:**
- It might be called "SIP Trunk," "Connection," or "SIP Domain"
- Give it a clear name like `toughtongue-production` so you remember what it's for

This trunk is the communication bridge between your provider and ToughTongue AI.

### Step 2: Set Up Termination (For Outbound Calls)

Configure how ToughTongue AI will send outbound calls through your provider.

**Create credentials:**

<CodeGroup>
```plaintext SIP Username
ttai_outbound_user
(Choose something secure)
```

```plaintext SIP Password
Use a strong password: 
- At least 12 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
```
</CodeGroup>

**Save your Termination URI:** Your provider will show you a termination endpoint (something like `yourname.pstn.twilio.com`). Copy this—you'll need it in Step 4.

These credentials let ToughTongue AI authenticate when placing calls on your behalf.

### Step 3: Assign Your Phone Number

Link the phone number(s) you want to use to this SIP trunk.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Twilio">
    **Phone Numbers → Select number → Configure → SIP Trunk**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Telnyx">
    **Numbers → Click number → Assign to Connection**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Vonage">
    **Numbers section in SIP setup wizard**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Plivo">
    **Numbers → Add to Endpoint**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Exotel">
    **Phone Numbers → Connect to SIP Trunk**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can assign multiple numbers to the same trunk if needed.

### Step 4: Connect the Number in ToughTongue AI

Now bring it all together in your ToughTongue AI dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to SIP Configuration">
    Go to **Scenario Details → Phone Call → SIP Configuration**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill in Details">
    - **Phone Number:** Your number in +E.164 format (e.g., `+12125551234`)
    - **Termination URI:** The endpoint from Step 2
    - **SIP Username:** From Step 2
    - **SIP Password:** From Step 2
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

**That's it!** Your phone number is now live and connected to your AI agents.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Setup & Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will I know if my setup is wrong before making a call?">
    No, ToughTongue AI can't validate your configuration until a call is attempted. We recommend making a test call immediately after setup to verify everything works.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do I need to create a separate SIP trunk for each number?">
    No, you can assign multiple numbers to the same SIP trunk. One trunk can handle many numbers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Provider-Specific

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm using Twilio. Any specific tips?">
    - When creating your SIP trunk, make sure to enable call transfer and check "Enable PSTN transfer"

  </Accordion>
