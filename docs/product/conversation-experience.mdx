Our agents don't just talk—they use tools like a human coach would.

## Available Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **Image Generation** | Creates visuals to set context (e.g., show a customer scenario) |
| **Google Slides** | Navigates through your presentations during practice |
| **Whiteboard** | Draws diagrams to explain frameworks |
| **Notepad** | Opens editor for documentation practice |
| **Code Editor** | For technical interviews with real-time feedback |

## Multimodal Understanding

The AI reads more than your words:

- **Voice tone:** Detects confidence, hesitation, defensiveness
- **Pacing:** Notices when you rush through objections
- **Facial expressions:** Reads engagement and reactions
- **Body language:** Understands visual cues

## Memory

Enable memory so the AI remembers past sessions:

> "Last time you struggled with pricing objections. Let's focus on those today."

This creates coaching continuity—not isolated practice sessions.

**Configure:** [Settings → Memories](https://app.toughtongueai.com/settings?tab=memories)

## Session Guarantees

- **12 minutes** of uninterrupted session time guaranteed
- **Auto-retry:** Connection issues trigger automatic recovery
- **Smart recovery:** Agent acknowledges interruption and continues

**Heavy usage note:** Sessions with video input, PDFs, or continuous whiteboard
may reach token limits sooner.

## Session Restoration

If disconnected:
1. Go to [Sessions page](https://app.toughtongueai.com/sessions)
2. Click restore button
3. AI resumes from where you left off

Works for: token limits, internet issues, or breaking long conversations
into segments.
