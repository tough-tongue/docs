Start with our [sales collection](https://app.toughtongueai.com/collections/69459888a2399791377a4e40/):

- **Cold Call Simulation:** Skeptical VP who'll hang up if you don't prove value
- **Objection Handling:** AI explains objection, then you practice responding
- **Retail Floor Training:** Visual scenarios with customer cues

### 2. Build Your Own

The AI learns from your content and creates scenarios matching your
selling environment.

## FAQ

**Is org context required?**  
No. Start with pre-built scenarios immediately. Your context makes training
more relevant but isn't required.

**How much context should I provide?**  
Upload 20 worst calls (what to avoid) + 20 best calls (what to replicate),
plus product docs and playbooks.
