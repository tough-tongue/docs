## The Challenge

Most GTM enablement teams face an impossible tradeoff:

- **Small teams, distributed reps:** Stretch thin with fewer practice sessions per rep
- **Scale vs. Quality:** Either sacrifice coaching quality to cover more ground, or leave reps underprepared
- **One-size-fits-all training:** Generic scenarios that don't match your actual selling environment
- **No practice safety net:** Reps learn on real prospects, with real deal consequences

ToughTongue AI changes this equation: **High-quality, consistent coaching across every rep without adding headcount.**

## Build Your Own Scenarios

### Adding Your Context

The more context you provide, the better your scenarios become:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Sales Call Recordings">
    - 20 recordings of your worst calls (to teach AI what to avoid)
    - 20 recordings of your best calls (to replicate top performer techniques)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Product Materials">
    - Pitch decks and product documentation
    - Competitive battle cards
    - Pricing and positioning guides
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Include Sales Methodology">
    - Your sales playbook (MEDDIC, Challenger, etc.)
    - Objection handling scripts

  </Step>
</Steps>

The AI learns from your materials and creates scenarios that mirror your actual selling environment.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is organizational context required to start?">
    **No.** You can start practicing immediately with our pre-built scenarios. Adding your own context makes training more relevant to your specific selling environment, but it's not required to get value.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I bring organizational context?">
    The more context you provide, the better your scenarios become. Recommended approach:
    
    - Upload 20 recordings of your worst calls (to teach AI what to avoid)
    - Upload 20 recordings of your best calls (to replicate top performer techniques)
    - Add product documentation and competitive positioning
    - Include your sales playbook and methodology

  </Accordion>

    Track correlation between practice volume and sales outcomes:
    
    - Reps who practice 5+ scenarios close 23% more deals (industry avg)
