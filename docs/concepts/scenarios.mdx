# Scenarios

Scenarios are the foundation of ToughTongue AI. A scenario defines the context, behavior, and rules for an AI conversation.

## What is a Scenario?

A scenario is a configuration that tells the AI:

- **Who** it should act as (role/persona)
- **How** it should behave (tone, style, approach)
- **What** topics to focus on
- **Why** the conversation is happening (context)

  ```mermaid graph LR A[Scenario] --> B[AI Instructions] A --> C[Context/Documents] A -->
  D[Evaluation Criteria] B --> E[Conversation] C --> E D --> F[Analysis] E --> F ```
</Frame>

## Key Components

### Name & Description

- **Name**: Internal identifier for your scenario
- **Description**: Team-facing notes about the scenario's purpose
- **User-Friendly Description**: What users see before starting

```json
{
  "name": "Customer Support - Billing Issues",
  "description": "Train agents on handling billing disputes",
  "user_friendly_description": "Practice resolving customer billing concerns with empathy and efficiency"
}
```

### AI Instructions

The most important part - tells the AI how to behave:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good Example
You are Sarah, a frustrated customer who received an unexpected charge of $299 on your credit card from TechCorp. You've been a customer for 3 years and this is your first issue.

Behavior Guidelines:

- Start frustrated but not aggressive
- Become calmer if the agent shows empathy
- Ask clarifying questions about the charge
- Want a refund or detailed explanation
- Mention you're considering canceling if not resolved

Keep the conversation realistic and allow the agent to guide the resolution.

````

```text Bad Example
You are a customer service trainer. Talk to the agent.
````

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  **Pro Tips for AI Instructions:** - Be specific about the role and context - Define the emotional
  tone and how it should evolve - Set clear objectives for the conversation - Include constraints
  (time, topics, difficulty) - Mention when to wrap up the conversation
</Tip>

### Context & Documents

Upload PDFs or provide text context to give the AI additional knowledge:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Product Documentation">
    Upload product manuals, specifications, or guidelines for the AI to reference during
    conversations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Company Policies">
    Provide company policies, procedures, or FAQs that the AI should follow or reference.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Training Materials">
    Add training documents or rubrics to ensure conversations align with your methodology.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

```json
{
  "pdf_context": "base64_encoded_pdf_here"
}
```

### Evaluation Criteria (Rubric)

Define how conversations should be evaluated:

```json
{
  "rubrik": {
    "criteria": [
      {
        "name": "Empathy",
        "description": "Shows understanding and care for customer concerns",
        "weight": 0.3
      },
      {
        "name": "Problem Solving",
        "description": "Effectively identifies and resolves the issue",
        "weight": 0.4
      },
      {
        "name": "Communication",
        "description": "Clear, professional, and appropriate language",
        "weight": 0.3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Scenario Types

## Best Practices

<Card title="Writing Effective AI Instructions" icon="lightbulb">
  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="1. Set Clear Context">
      Start with who the AI is, their background, and the situation: ✅ "You are Dr. Smith, a family
      physician with 20 years of experience..." ❌ "You are a doctor."
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="2. Define Objectives">
      What should happen in this conversation? ✅ "Your goal is to understand the patient's symptoms
      and provide preliminary advice..." ❌ "Talk to the patient."
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="3. Set Boundaries">
      What topics or behaviors to avoid: ✅ "Do not provide specific medical diagnoses. Recommend
      seeing a specialist for serious symptoms." ❌ No boundaries set
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="4. Include Evolution">
      How should the AI's tone or approach change during the conversation? ✅ "Start defensive, but
      become more open to solutions if the sales person shows understanding..." ❌ Static behavior
      throughout
