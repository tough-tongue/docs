## Why ToughTongue AI?

### Lovable for Voice AI Agents

Just like Lovable makes full-stack development accessible, ToughTongue AI makes voice AI agent development accessible. **Build without low-level pipeline maintenance:**

- ❌ No managing WebSocket connections
- ❌ No configuring STT/TTS pipelines
- ❌ No handling audio streaming logic
- ❌ No managing inference infrastructure

✅ **Just describe what you want your agent to do, and we handle the rest.**

### Voice AI Agents, Not Chatbots

Our agents don't just respond to text. They:

- **Listen** to your voice, tone, pacing, and confidence
- **See** your facial expressions and body language
- **Act** with real tools—generating images, navigating slides, sketching diagrams
- **Remember** past conversations for personalized coaching
- **Analyze** conversations for actionable feedback

### Complete Workflow

**Prepare** → **Practice** → **Debrief**

1. **Smart Prep:** AI generates personalized agendas based on your goals
2. **Realistic Practice:** Ultra-low latency conversations that feel natural
3. **Actionable Feedback:** Detailed analysis of what worked and what didn't

## Three Ways to Build

### Scenario

One-off roleplay targeting a single conversation. Perfect for tomorrow's interview, next week's negotiation, or a call with a difficult customer in an hour.

**Example:** "Technical Cold Call Simulation"—practice pitching a developer tool to a skeptical VP who will hang up if you don't demonstrate value immediately.

### Coach

A topic-focused AI coach that **remembers every session**, adapts to your style, and handles the menial coaching work—accountability, reflection, progress tracking.

**Example:** "Sales Coach Amanda"—remembers that you struggle with pricing objections and automatically focuses practice sessions on that weakness.

### Course

A structured learning experience combining AI roleplay with expert-led content. Get 1:1 attention at scale.

**Example:** "Complete Sales Bootcamp"—12 AI practice scenarios interwoven with video lessons from top sellers.
